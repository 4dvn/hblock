Assuming hBlock directory is /var/git/hBlock, you will have to change the
commands if you are using a different directory. You can edit hBlock.timer to
change the schedule for running hBlock, by default it is set to run every
Sunday at midnight.

Apologies for being too lazy to write an actual installer script, but it's only
four commands so is it really worth it?

Install steps:

sudo ln -s /var/git/hBlock/hBlock /usr/local/bin/hBlock
sudo systemctl enable /var/git/hBlock/systemd/hBlock.service
  (you may get a warning about not having an install directive,
  it is safe to ignore this because the install directive is in
  the hBlock.timer file that will get loaded next.)
sudo systemctl enable /var/git/hBlock/systemd/hBlock.timer
sudo systemctl start hBlock.timer
